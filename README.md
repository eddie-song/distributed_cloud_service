# Mini Cloud - Distributed KV (Go + Raft)

A small, opinionated distributed key–value service with:
- **Raft consensus** for leader election and replication
- **Dynamic membership** (join/remove nodes at runtime)
- **Bearer token authentication** for write operations
- **Prometheus metrics** and structured logging
- **Graceful shutdown** and durability via snapshots
- **CLI tool** and web dashboard

## 1) Prerequisites

- Go 1.22+ (or 1.23+ for Prometheus metrics)
- Windows PowerShell (recommended for commands below)
- Optional: Docker Desktop (for Docker Compose demo)
- Optional: `make` (for Makefile commands, or use `go` directly)

## 2) Project setup

Open PowerShell at the project root:
```
C:\Users\eddie\OneDrive\Documents\Projects\distributed_cloud_service
```

Fetch dependencies, run tests, and build:
```powershell
go mod tidy
go test ./...
go build ./cmd/node
go build ./cmd/cloudctl
```

Or use Makefile:
```powershell
make test          # Run all tests
make test-coverage # Run tests with coverage report
make build         # Build binaries
make clean         # Remove build artifacts
make help          # Show all commands
```

### Testing

The project includes comprehensive tests:
- **Unit tests**: Store, FSM, HTTP handlers
- **Integration tests**: Multi-node scenarios

Run tests:
```powershell
go test ./...              # All tests
go test ./internal/store   # Store tests only
go test ./test -v          # Integration tests
make test-coverage         # With coverage report
```

Test coverage:
- Store: 100%
- HTTP handlers: 61.5%
- Raft FSM: 17.6%

## 3) Run locally (single node or multi-node)

### Single node (leader-only)
Open a new PowerShell window at the project root and run:
```powershell
go run ./cmd/node -config configs/node1.yaml
```
- Dashboard: open http://127.0.0.1:9001/dashboard
- Health: `curl.exe http://127.0.0.1:9001/health`
- **Note**: You may see connection errors in the logs (like `dial tcp 127.0.0.1:9012: connectex: No connection could be made`). These are harmless - Raft is trying to reach peers that aren't running. The single node will still work and become the leader.

### Multi-node (3 processes)
Open three PowerShell windows (one per node):
```powershell
# Window 1 (bootstrap leader)
go run ./cmd/node -config configs\node1.yaml

# Window 2 (auto-joins leader)
go run ./cmd/node -config configs\node2.yaml

# Window 3 (auto-joins leader)
go run ./cmd/node -config configs\node3.yaml
```
Notes:
- `configs/node1.yaml` has `bootstrap: true`. Use it only for first-time cluster creation with an empty `data/`.
- `configs/node2.yaml` and `node3.yaml` have `bootstrap: false` and a `join_url` pointing to node1; they auto-join.
- **Single node works fine**: A single bootstrapped node will become the leader and work normally. Connection errors in logs are harmless.
- **Multi-node quorum**: For a 3-node cluster, you need at least 2 nodes running to form a quorum and handle leader failover.

## 4) Run with Docker Compose (3-node demo)

Docker uses separate configs (`docker-node*.yaml`) with service names for Raft addresses.

From the project root:
```powershell
docker compose build
docker compose up -d
```
Then:
- Dashboard: open http://localhost:9001/dashboard
- Logs: `docker compose logs -f node1`
- Tear down: `docker compose down -v`

## 5) Testing features

Use `curl.exe` in PowerShell (to avoid PowerShell’s Invoke-WebRequest differences). You can run these against any node.

### 5.1 Key–Value API (leader writes, any-node reads)
- PUT store value
```powershell
curl.exe -X PUT http://127.0.0.1:9001/kv/foo -d "bar"
```
- GET retrieve value
```powershell
curl.exe http://127.0.0.1:9001/kv/foo
```
- DELETE remove key
```powershell
curl.exe -X DELETE http://127.0.0.1:9001/kv/foo
```

### 5.2 Leader-only writes with follower redirects (HTTP 307)
Try writing to a follower (e.g., node2 at port 9002):
```powershell
curl.exe -i -X PUT http://127.0.0.1:9002/kv/redirect-test -d "ok"
```
- Expected: `HTTP/1.1 307 Temporary Redirect` and a `Location` header pointing to the leader’s HTTP URL.
- Follow the redirect automatically:
```powershell
curl.exe -L -X PUT http://127.0.0.1:9002/kv/redirect-test -d "ok"
```
- Verify on any node:
```powershell
curl.exe http://127.0.0.1:9003/kv/redirect-test
```

### 5.3 Dynamic membership (join voters at runtime)
Auto-join is configured in `configs/node2.yaml`/`node3.yaml` via `join_url`.
To join manually (leader only), POST to `/raft/join` on the leader:
```powershell
curl.exe -X POST http://127.0.0.1:9001/raft/join -H "Content-Type: application/json" -d '{"node_id":"nodeX","raft_addr":"127.0.0.1:90XX"}'
```
Inspect live membership (any node):
```powershell
curl.exe http://127.0.0.1:9001/raft/config
curl.exe http://127.0.0.1:9001/cluster/members
```

### 5.4 Durability via snapshots (state survives restarts)
```powershell
# Write some durable data
curl.exe -X PUT http://127.0.0.1:9001/kv/durable -d "value"

# Stop a node (Ctrl+C where it runs), then start it again with the same config
# Verify value still present (committed state restored)
curl.exe http://127.0.0.1:9001/kv/durable
```

### 5.5 Raft status and health
- Raft status (per node):
```powershell
curl.exe http://127.0.0.1:9001/raft/status
```
- Health:
```powershell
curl.exe http://127.0.0.1:9001/health
```

### 5.6 Authentication (Bearer Token)
If `auth_token` is set in config or `AUTH_TOKEN` env var is provided, write operations (PUT/DELETE) require a Bearer token:
```powershell
# Set token (example)
$env:AUTH_TOKEN="my-secret-token"

# Write with token
curl.exe -X PUT http://127.0.0.1:9001/kv/protected -H "Authorization: Bearer my-secret-token" -d "value"

# Without token (fails with 401)
curl.exe -X PUT http://127.0.0.1:9001/kv/protected -d "value"
```

### 5.7 Prometheus Metrics
Metrics endpoint (no auth required):
```powershell
curl.exe http://127.0.0.1:9001/metrics
```
Metrics include:
- HTTP request counts and latency
- KV operations (PUT/GET/DELETE counts)
- Raft state (leader status, applied/commit indices)

### 5.8 Node Removal (Leader Only)
Remove a node from the cluster:
```powershell
curl.exe -X POST http://127.0.0.1:9001/raft/remove -H "Content-Type: application/json" -d '{"node_id":"node2"}'
```

### 5.9 Graceful Shutdown
Nodes handle SIGINT/SIGTERM gracefully:
- HTTP server stops accepting new connections
- Raft node shuts down cleanly
- In-flight requests complete (10s timeout)
- Press Ctrl+C in the node terminal to trigger shutdown

### 5.10 Leader Failover Testing
Test leader reassignment by killing the leader and observing a new leader election.

**Step 1: Start multiple nodes**
```powershell
# Terminal 1 - Node 1 (bootstrap)
go run ./cmd/node -config configs/node1.yaml

# Terminal 2 - Node 2
go run ./cmd/node -config configs/node2.yaml

# Terminal 3 - Node 3
go run ./cmd/node -config configs/node3.yaml
```

**Step 2: Identify the current leader**
```powershell
# Check which node is leader
curl.exe http://127.0.0.1:9001/raft/status
curl.exe http://127.0.0.1:9002/raft/status
curl.exe http://127.0.0.1:9003/raft/status
# Look for "is_leader": true
```

**Step 3: Kill the leader**
```powershell
# IMPORTANT: You need to kill the process that owns BOTH the HTTP port AND Raft port
# Find the process ID for the leader (e.g., if node1 is leader on ports 9001 and 9011)
$pid = (Get-NetTCPConnection -LocalPort 9001 -ErrorAction SilentlyContinue | Select-Object -First 1 -ExpandProperty OwningProcess)
if ($pid) {
    Write-Host "Killing process $pid (node1)" -ForegroundColor Yellow
    Stop-Process -Id $pid -Force
} else {
    Write-Host "No process found on port 9001" -ForegroundColor Red
}

# Alternative: Find by Raft port (9011 for node1)
$pid = (Get-NetTCPConnection -LocalPort 9011 -ErrorAction SilentlyContinue | Select-Object -First 1 -ExpandProperty OwningProcess)
Stop-Process -Id $pid -Force
```

**Step 4: Observe new leader election**
```powershell
# Wait 2-5 seconds for election (Raft election timeout is ~500ms, but allow time for detection)
Write-Host "Waiting for leader election..." -ForegroundColor Cyan
Start-Sleep -Seconds 3

# Check remaining nodes
curl.exe http://127.0.0.1:9002/raft/status
curl.exe http://127.0.0.1:9003/raft/status
# One should show "is_leader": true

# If no leader appears, wait longer (up to 10 seconds) and check again
```

**Step 5: Verify cluster still works**
```powershell
# Write to the new leader
curl.exe -X PUT http://127.0.0.1:9002/kv/test -d "value" -H "Content-Type: application/octet-stream"

# Read from any remaining node
curl.exe http://127.0.0.1:9003/kv/test
```

**Monitor all nodes during failover:**
```powershell
# Run this in a loop to watch leader election
while ($true) {
    Clear-Host
    Write-Host "=== Cluster Status $(Get-Date -Format 'HH:mm:ss') ===" -ForegroundColor Cyan
    $hasLeader = $false
    @(9001, 9002, 9003) | ForEach-Object {
        $port = $_
        try {
            $status = curl.exe -s http://127.0.0.1:$port/raft/status | ConvertFrom-Json
            $health = curl.exe -s http://127.0.0.1:$port/health
            if ($status.is_leader) {
                $hasLeader = $true
                $color = "Green"
            } else {
                $color = "Yellow"
            }
            Write-Host "Port $port : $($status.state) | Leader: $($status.is_leader) | Health: $health" -ForegroundColor $color
        } catch {
            Write-Host "Port $port : DOWN" -ForegroundColor Red
        }
    }
    if (-not $hasLeader) {
        Write-Host "`nWARNING: No leader detected! Waiting for election..." -ForegroundColor Red
    }
    Start-Sleep -Seconds 1
}
# Then kill the leader process (Ctrl+C in another terminal) and watch the election happen
```

**Quick script to kill leader and verify:**
```powershell
# Find and kill the leader
$leaderPort = $null
@(9001, 9002, 9003) | ForEach-Object {
    $port = $_
    try {
        $status = curl.exe -s http://127.0.0.1:$port/raft/status | ConvertFrom-Json
        if ($status.is_leader) {
            $leaderPort = $port
            Write-Host "Found leader on port $port" -ForegroundColor Green
            $pid = (Get-NetTCPConnection -LocalPort $port -ErrorAction SilentlyContinue | Select-Object -First 1 -ExpandProperty OwningProcess)
            if ($pid) {
                Write-Host "Killing process $pid..." -ForegroundColor Yellow
                Stop-Process -Id $pid -Force
            }
        }
    } catch {
        # Node might be down, skip
    }
}

# Wait for election
Write-Host "`nWaiting for new leader election (2 seconds)..." -ForegroundColor Cyan
Start-Sleep -Seconds 2

# Check for new leader
Write-Host "`nChecking for new leader:" -ForegroundColor Cyan
@(9001, 9002, 9003) | ForEach-Object {
    $port = $_
    try {
        $status = curl.exe -s http://127.0.0.1:$port/raft/status | ConvertFrom-Json
        if ($status.is_leader) {
            Write-Host "  Port $port is now the leader!" -ForegroundColor Green
        } else {
            Write-Host "  Port $port : $($status.state)" -ForegroundColor Yellow
        }
    } catch {
        Write-Host "  Port $port : DOWN" -ForegroundColor Red
    }
}
```

**Troubleshooting leader election:**
- **Single node mode**: Works fine! A single bootstrapped node will become the leader. Connection errors in logs are harmless - Raft is trying to reach peers that aren't running.
- **Multi-node quorum**: For a 3-node cluster, you need at least 2 nodes running to form a quorum and handle leader failover.
  - If only 1 node is running in a multi-node setup, you'll see connection errors like: `dial tcp 127.0.0.1:9012: connectex: No connection could be made because the target machine actively refused it`
  - This is normal - the single node can't reach the others, but it will still work as a single-node cluster
- **Connection refused errors**: These are harmless if you're running a single node. For multi-node, start all nodes to form a cluster.
- **Election takes too long**: Raft uses randomized timeouts (500ms-1s) to prevent split votes. With the updated code, elections should complete in 1-2 seconds.
- **Wrong process killed**: Make sure you killed the process that owns both HTTP and Raft ports
- **Process restarted**: Check if the process auto-restarted (some IDEs/terminals do this)
- **Still no leader after 5 seconds**: Restart all nodes to ensure they're using the updated timeout settings

### 5.11 CLI (optional)
Build once:
```powershell
go build ./cmd/cloudctl
```
Use:
```powershell
# Against node1
.\cloudctl.exe put foo bar
.\cloudctl.exe get foo
.\cloudctl.exe delete foo
.\cloudctl.exe members
.\cloudctl.exe status
# Different node
.\cloudctl.exe -server http://127.0.0.1:9002 put k v
```

## 5A) Complete Operations Guide

This section provides a comprehensive reference for all operations you can perform on the servers.

### Basic Key-Value Operations

**PUT - Store a value:**
```powershell
curl.exe -X PUT http://127.0.0.1:9001/kv/mykey -d "Hello World" -H "Content-Type: application/octet-stream"
# Expected: 200 OK (or 307 redirect if not leader)
```

**GET - Retrieve a value:**
```powershell
curl.exe http://127.0.0.1:9001/kv/mykey
# Expected: "Hello World"
```

**DELETE - Remove a key:**
```powershell
curl.exe -X DELETE http://127.0.0.1:9001/kv/mykey
# Expected: 200 OK
curl.exe http://127.0.0.1:9001/kv/mykey
# Expected: 404 Key not found
```

### Leader Detection & Redirects

**Check which node is leader:**
```powershell
curl.exe http://127.0.0.1:9001/raft/status
curl.exe http://127.0.0.1:9002/raft/status
curl.exe http://127.0.0.1:9003/raft/status
# Look for "is_leader": true
```

**Test follower redirect (write to non-leader):**
```powershell
# If node2 is not leader, try writing to it:
curl.exe -v -X PUT http://127.0.0.1:9002/kv/test -d "value"
# Expected: 307 Temporary Redirect with Location header pointing to leader
```

### Cluster Membership

**View all cluster members (from Raft):**
```powershell
curl.exe http://127.0.0.1:9001/cluster/members
# Expected: JSON with all nodes in the cluster
```

**View node status:**
```powershell
curl.exe http://127.0.0.1:9001/cluster/status
# Expected: node_id, address, peers
```

### Data Replication (Multi-Node)

**Write to leader, read from followers:**
```powershell
# Write to node1 (if leader)
curl.exe -X PUT http://127.0.0.1:9001/kv/replicated -d "This should appear on all nodes"

# Wait 1-2 seconds for replication, then read from other nodes:
curl.exe http://127.0.0.1:9002/kv/replicated
curl.exe http://127.0.0.1:9003/kv/replicated
# Expected: "This should appear on all nodes" from all nodes
```

### Dynamic Node Management

**Join a new node (if you have a 4th node config):**
```powershell
curl.exe -X POST http://127.0.0.1:9001/raft/join `
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" `
  -d '{"node_id":"node4","raft_addr":"127.0.0.1:9014"}'
# Expected: 204 No Content
```

**Remove a node:**
```powershell
curl.exe -X POST http://127.0.0.1:9001/raft/remove `
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" `
  -d '{"node_id":"node3"}'
# Expected: 204 No Content
# Then check members - node3 should be gone
curl.exe http://127.0.0.1:9001/cluster/members
```

### Health & Monitoring

**Health check:**
```powershell
curl.exe http://127.0.0.1:9001/health
# Expected: "OK"
```

**Prometheus metrics:**
```powershell
curl.exe http://127.0.0.1:9001/metrics
# Expected: Prometheus-formatted metrics (lots of text)
```

**View specific metrics:**
```powershell
curl.exe http://127.0.0.1:9001/metrics | Select-String "kv_|raft_|http_request"
```

### Raft Configuration

**View Raft config:**
```powershell
curl.exe http://127.0.0.1:9001/raft/config
# Expected: JSON with server list
```

**View Raft status:**
```powershell
curl.exe http://127.0.0.1:9001/raft/status
# Expected: is_leader, leader address, state
```

### Web Dashboard

**Open in browser:**
```powershell
Start-Process "http://127.0.0.1:9001/dashboard"
# Or manually navigate to: http://127.0.0.1:9001/dashboard
```

### Complete Test Sequence

curl.exe -s http://127.0.0.1:9001/metrics | Select-String "kv_put_operations_total|kv_get_operations_total|raft_is_leader"
```

### Authentication (if enabled)

**Test with auth token:**
```powershell
# Set token in config or env
$env:AUTH_TOKEN = "my-secret-token"

# Write without token (should fail)
curl.exe -X PUT http://127.0.0.1:9001/kv/secret -d "data"
# Expected: 401 Unauthorized

# Write with token (should succeed)
curl.exe -X PUT http://127.0.0.1:9001/kv/secret -d "data" `
  -H "Authorization: Bearer my-secret-token"
# Expected: 200 OK

# Read doesn't require auth
curl.exe http://127.0.0.1:9001/kv/secret
# Expected: "data"
```

### Data Persistence Test

**Test snapshot/restore:**
```powershell
# 1. Store data
curl.exe -X PUT http://127.0.0.1:9001/kv/persistent -d "survives restart"

# 2. Stop node1 (Ctrl+C or kill process)

# 3. Restart node1
go run ./cmd/node -config configs/node1.yaml

# 4. Wait a few seconds, then read
curl.exe http://127.0.0.1:9001/kv/persistent
# Expected: "survives restart" (if snapshot was taken)
```

### Quick Reference Commands

**One-liners for common checks:**
```powershell
# Who's the leader?
curl.exe -s http://127.0.0.1:9001/raft/status | ConvertFrom-Json | Select-Object is_leader, leader, state

# How many members?
(curl.exe -s http://127.0.0.1:9001/cluster/members | ConvertFrom-Json).members.Count

# Request counts?
curl.exe -s http://127.0.0.1:9001/metrics | Select-String "kv_.*_total"
```

## 6) Configuration reference (YAML)
Each node supports:
```yaml
node_id: "node1"
listen_addr: "127.0.0.1:9001"  # HTTP address (use 127.0.0.1 for local, 0.0.0.0 for Docker)
raft_addr: "127.0.0.1:9011"   # Raft address (optional; defaults to http+10). Must be specific IP, not 0.0.0.0
bootstrap: true                # Only one node should bootstrap a fresh cluster
join_url: ""                   # Followers set this to leader HTTP base, e.g. http://127.0.0.1:9001
auth_token: ""                 # Optional bearer token for write operations (env AUTH_TOKEN overrides)
```
Notes:
- If reusing a `data/` directory, set `bootstrap: false` (existing state wins).
- If `raft_addr` is omitted, it's derived as `http_port + 10`.
- `auth_token` can be set in YAML or via `AUTH_TOKEN` environment variable (env takes precedence).
- **Important**: `raft_addr` must be a specific IP address (e.g., `127.0.0.1` or your network IP), not `0.0.0.0`. Use `0.0.0.0` only for `listen_addr` in Docker.

## 7) Shutting Down All Nodes

**Complete shutdown command:**
```powershell
# Kill all processes using the node ports
Get-NetTCPConnection -LocalPort 9001,9002,9003,9011,9012,9013 -ErrorAction SilentlyContinue | 
    Select-Object -ExpandProperty OwningProcess -Unique | 
    ForEach-Object { Stop-Process -Id $_ -Force -ErrorAction SilentlyContinue }

# Also kill any node processes from go-build
Get-Process | Where-Object {$_.ProcessName -eq "node" -and $_.Path -like "*go-build*"} | 
    Stop-Process -Force -ErrorAction SilentlyContinue

# Verify all ports are free
Get-NetTCPConnection -LocalPort 9001,9002,9003,9011,9012,9013 -ErrorAction SilentlyContinue
# Should return nothing if all processes are stopped
```

**Alternative: Kill all Go processes (be careful - kills ALL Go processes):**
```powershell
Get-Process go | Stop-Process -Force
Get-Process | Where-Object {$_.ProcessName -eq "node" -and $_.Path -like "*go-build*"} | Stop-Process -Force
```

**If dashboard still loads after shutdown:**
- Check browser cache - try hard refresh (Ctrl+F5) or open in incognito/private mode
- Verify ports are actually free: `Get-NetTCPConnection -LocalPort 9001,9002,9003`
- Check if Docker containers are running: `docker ps` (if using Docker Compose)
